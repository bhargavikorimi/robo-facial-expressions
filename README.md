## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Expressions
```python
def draw_new_expression(self):
    self.target_mouth_curve = 0.5  # Mouth curvature (-1.0 to 1.0)
    self.target_eye_shape = 0.0    # Eye shape (0.0 = circular, 1.0 = heart)
    self.target_expression = "new_expression"
```

### Adding New Emotion Patterns
```python
new_patterns = [
    'pattern1', 'pattern2', 'pattern3'
]

for pattern in new_patterns:
    if pattern in text_lower:
        return {'emotion': 'new_emotion', 'confidence': 0.95}
```

### Customizing Colors
```python
# Change theme colors
BG = "#your_background_color"
NEON = "#your_neon_color"
BLUSH = "#your_blush_color"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Microphone Not Working**
- Check microphone permissions
- Ensure microphone is not being used by other applications
- Try adjusting microphone sensitivity in system settings

#### **Speech Recognition Errors**
- Verify internet connection (Google Speech API requires internet)
- Check microphone quality and background noise
- Try speaking more clearly and slowly

#### **Performance Issues**
- Close other applications to free up CPU
- Reduce animation complexity if needed
- Check system memory usage

#### **Charging Detection Not Working**
- Ensure `psutil` library is properly installed
- Check if your system supports battery monitoring
- Verify laptop charging status manually
